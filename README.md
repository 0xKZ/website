# Public Website Repo

This is a public repository because I don't want to pay money to host a static page from a private repository.

The website is ugly and simple because it gets the job done and I want to minimize my maintenence effort.



# Setup

## Install Node.js >= v14

Just follow the 11ty instructions under quick start: https://www.11ty.dev/

## Run the static site generator

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```
