        <h2>What I do</h2>
        
        <p>I'm a software engineer at the Uber Advanced Technologies Group, working on motion planning for self driving cars. On the side, I like to design and build games.</p>
		
		<p>I live in Pittsburgh, PA. Previously I lived in Seattle, WA, working at Amazon.</p>

		<h2>Gamedev</h2>
		
		<p>I taught myself programming in order to bring my ideas for games to life when I was about 13 years old. After building a number of freeware games, I started my first "big" game (i.e, that I intended to sell) at the age of 17. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/328990/Koya_Rift/">Koya Rift</a> was the result after 1.5 years of work. It's not very good, but I'm happy I saw it through to completion. It was a valuable learning experience!</p>
		
		<p>I've been working on and off on other projects since, but I am not ready to show anything here yet. Be patient!</p>
