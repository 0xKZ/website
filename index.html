        <h2>About Me</h2>

		<p> Right now, I'm working full-ish-time on a video game project of mine. I don't have anything further to share yet - stay tuned! </p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        
		<p>I'm "retired" from software engineering for now and taking a sabbatical to work on side projects. I am not looking for work, but you're welcome to try and pitch an idea to me :) </p>

        <p>Most recently, I was a software engineer at Meta Reality Labs Research (formerly called Oculus Research). I built simulators and other tools to advance the state of the art in photonics, optics, and display systems. </p>
		
		<p>Previously, I worked at the Uber Advanced Technologies Group, working on motion planning for self driving cars. Before that, I worked at Amazon on backend software, and a robotics lab before that. </p>

		<h2>Gamedev</h2>
		
		<p>I taught myself programming in order to bring my ideas for games to life when I was about 13 years old. After building a number of freeware games, I started my first "big" game (i.e, that I intended to sell) at the age of 17. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/328990/Koya_Rift/">Koya Rift</a> was the result after 1.5 years of work. It's not very good, but I'm happy I saw it through to completion. It was a valuable learning experience!</p>
		
		<p>I've been working on and off on other projects since, which I will eventually share here.</p>
